<BR>
On the RoboRIO this reads the high resolution FPGA time.  The resolution, not accuracy, of the FPGA timer is 1 microsecond.  The normal FPGA clock register (32 bits) rolls over approximately every 71 minutes.  To significantly extend the rollover time,, this routine reads both the high and low FPGA clock registers.  High/low register turnover read sequencing is dealt with by reading the high register twice, once before and once after the low register.  If the values are different, the read is repeated to assure consistency between the high and low values.  On a PC the standard operating system timer with 1 millisecond resolution is used.  <BR>
<BR>
Notes:<BR>
-------<BR>
- On the RoboRIO this routine takes approximately 2.1 microseconds to execute.   When both words of the FPGA clock have to be read the routine takes approximately 4.2 microseconds.  This occurs once every 71 minutes when the routine determines that the low word has rolled over.  The WPI read FPGA clock routine takes approxmately 2.1 microseconds.  The difference can be attributed to this routine reading to extra words from the FPGA.  Each FPGA read takes approximately 1 microsecond.  <BR>
<BR>
- Set a conditional complilation variable TRAJLIB_USEOSTIME and set it to a value of 1 to force this routine to read the RoboRIO operating system time instead of the FPGA time.  This will have 1 millisecond resolution.  This routine executes faster, approx 1 microsecond.<BR>
<BR>
 - On the RoboRIO there is some drift between the FPGA and operating system clocks.  The drift isn't consistent, but appears to be approximately 20 milliseconds / hour.  This isn't enough to be of concern.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Input parameters:<BR>
  - PassThroughTime  --  double float --  If wired and the value is > 0 then this time is passed through and the FPGA time is not read.  Allows calling functions to use a single time instant if desired.<BR>
  - Input Error  --  Input error cluster<BR>
<BR>
Returns:<BR>
  -  FPGA_Time_Seconds  --  double float  --  Elapsed time in seconds.<BR>
  -  FPGA_Time_Microseconds  --   Uint64 --  Elapsed time in microseconds (This can be used as an input to the Network Table routines to sychnronize times.)<BR>
  -  Output Error  --  Output error cluster.  An error will be returned if there are problems reading the FPGA or of the FPGA clock high register changes twice while reading the value.<BR>
<BR>
Custom Errors:<BR>
  -  8020  --  The upper FPGA time register changed during both attempts to read the FPGA time values.  The returned time may not be valid.</pre></p>

  --  The file name can be a simple file or an absolute path.  If a simple file name is used the default path on the RoboRIO is:  "home:\lvuser\natinst\LabVIEW Data".  On a Windows PC the default path is the LabVIEW default directory.  Normally this is: “%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Documents\LabView Data".<BR>
  --  Filenames on the RoboRIO, which runs Linux, are case sensitive.<BR>
<BR>
Notes on file contents:<BR>
  --  Blank lines are ignored.<BR>
  --  Lines that begin with either #, !, or ' in the first character are considered comments and are ignored. <BR>
  -- Other lines are interpretted as comma separated data as follows:<BR>
          --  Trajectory time -- seconds<BR>
          --  Expected velocity  --  meters/sec<BR>
          --  Expected acceleration -- meters/sec^2<BR>
          --  Expected X position -- meters<BR>
          --  Expected Y position --  meters<BR>
          --  Expected heading (not necessarily robot orientation)  -- radians<BR>
          --  Expected curvature (rotational portion of velocity)  --  radians/meter<BR>
          --  Optional comment string.  This ignored when reading file<BR>
